# Initial Requirement Specification (IRS) for Simple Hotel Booking Application
# 1. Introduction
This document outlines the foundational requirements for a smart contract designed to streamline operations within the hotel industry. The smart contract leverages blockchain technology to enhance transparency, efficiency, and security in managing hotel activities.
# 2. System Overview
The Hotel Booking Solidity Smart Contract is deployed on a blockchain platform, serving as a decentralized application tailored for hotels. It provides functionalities to:
1.	Track hotel tenants and their occupancy status.
2.	Manage details of the hotel landlord.
3.	Maintain a record of the total number of rooms available.
4.	Monitor agreements executed within the hotel.
5.	Keep track of the current count of tenants.

# 3. Functional Requirements
1.**Tenant Management:** Record tenant information including addresses and occupancy status.
2.**Landlord Administration:** Maintain details of the hotel's landlord for ownership clarity.
3.**Room Inventory:** Track the total number of rooms available for efficient management.
4.**Agreement Tracking:** Monitor and record agreements made within the hotel premises.
# 4. Non-Functional Requirements
1.	Security:
•	Ensure all data is securely stored on the blockchain.
•	Implement access controls for sensitive operations.
2.	Performance:
Optimize transaction fees for interacting with the smart contract.
3.	Scalability:
Design the system to handle growth in users and data.
4.	Usability:
Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
# 5. Components
•	Smart Contract: Contains logic for managing tenant, landlord, room, agreement, and tenant count data.
•	User Interface (UI): Provides a user-friendly platform for stakeholders to interact with the smart contract.
•	Integration with Blockchain: Deploys the smart contract on a suitable blockchain platform.

# 6. Data Flow
1.	Users interact with the UI to input and manage hotel data.
2.	The UI communicates with the smart contract to store and retrieve information.
3.	Data updates (tenant changes, agreements) are recorded securely on the blockchain.
4.	Hotel management uses the smart contract data for operational decisions.
   
# 7. Security Considerations
•	Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
•	Conduct thorough code audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
•	Secure storage solutions for sensitive data.

# 8. Integration Requirements
•	Integrate the smart contract with a compatible blockchain platform.
•	Optionally integrate with external services for enhanced functionalities.

# 9. Success Criteria
•	Enable efficient management of hotel operations through the smart contract.
•	Ensure transparency and reliability in data management.
•	Provide a seamless user experience for stakeholders.
